## 🚀 Interactive Developer Profile: Md Tausif Hussain

This repository hosts an interactive, single-page application (SPA) designed as a "Developer Insight Dashboard" to showcase the academic, technical, and competitive profile of **Md Tausif Hussain**.

It uses modern front-end tools, interactive data visualizations (Chart.js), and a dynamic 3D element (Three.js) to provide a rich, engaging, and data-driven overview of his skills and journey.

### ✨ Key Features

  * **Interactive Header:** A dynamic hero section featuring a manipulable **3D Icosahedron** built with **Three.js** that reacts to mouse interaction and animates automatically.
  * **Data-Driven Skills:** Uses **Chart.js** to display competency via a **Radar Chart** (Hard & Soft Skills) and a **Doughnut Chart** (Codebase Composition).
  * **Dynamic Insights:** Clicking on a segment of the language chart updates a descriptive text block, providing contextual analysis.
  * **Fluid UX:** Features smooth transitions for project detail expansion, timeline toggling, and fluid progress bars for mobile views.
  * **Auditory Feedback:** Implements simulated haptic feedback using **Tone.js** on action buttons for enhanced interactivity.
  * **Responsive Design:** Styled entirely with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, mobile-first experience.
  * **"Thanos Snap" Easter Egg:** Clicking the profile title triggers a short, disintegrating particle animation.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

The profile is built as a highly optimized static site using CDN imports for core libraries.
